#### Day 1: June 14 2020

**Today's Progress**: Did LC daily challenge, a hackerrank question and mostly spend time on ideating and find databases.

**Thoughts:** Will now maintain proper git discipline.

**Link to work:** 
Project 1: React + Node (Visualisation Project) Target 20 June 2020



#### Day 2: June 15 2020

**Today's Progress**: Did LC daily challenge, revising HTML and CSS, started work on chat application.  

**Thoughts:** Had to change the initial idea of a visualisation project, as a startup required knowledge to build a chat app.

#### Day 3: June 16 2020

**Today's Progress**: 3 LC questions, a rather odd bug made me work for hours. Finalized design and name of the application.
Found a great article by @rwieruch explaining API for beginners. Do read. https://www.robinwieruch.de/what-is-an-api-javascript

**Thoughts:** I hope some real coding work starts tomorrow.


#### Day 4: June 17 2020

**Today's Progress**: 5 questions on scalar platform and 3 on LC.
Used a terminal component in React FE. 

**Thoughts:**  Reuse your components and of others too!


#### Day 5: June 18 2020

**Today's Progress**: Interview given for openhouse. C++ program to check if a given string is a valid json or not. Some debugging required. 

**Thoughts:**  Object oriented code structure to be followed. Also learn/pracise regex.



#### Day 6: June 19 2020


**Today's Progress**: Researched on how to start contributing to open source projects.
In the JSON validator, I had missed the usual base cases. Strings, booleans and other base types are JSON too. LC questions as usual.

**Thoughts:**  Confused whether to buy a domain or use GitHub pages.



#### Day 7: June 21 2020

**Today's Progress**: I was not able to progress on Saturday, hence the challenge extended by a day. Decided to look at @freeCodeCamp courses, even though it seems I know much of it, doing it feels satisfying. Almost completed JavaScript and Basic Algorithms in 2 hours.

**Thoughts:** Need to give more time to the project instead of relearning old things.


#### Day 8: June 22 2020

**Today's Progress**: Day 8: Continued progress on freeCodeCamp. Started learning system design parallely.

**Thoughts:** I have lost count of on how many coding websites I have created my account.



#### Day 9: June 24 2020

**Today's Progress**: 
Attempted a virtual contest on LeetCode today.

**Thoughts:** A bad day and early sleep extended the challenge to one more day. It is difficult to maintain a streak, but all rewarding things require discipline. I will make sure no more discontinuity happens.


#### Day 10: June 25 2020

**Today's Progress**:Day 10: #100DaysOfCode. More #freeCodeCamp. Read about Tiers.
**Thoughts:** IMHO anyone aiming to be a developer should check it out.


#### Day 11: June 26 2020

**Today's Progress**: Day 11: #100DaysOfCode. Regex in JavaScript in #freecodecamp.
Got LinkedIn verification for C++ and JavaScript.

**Thoughts:** Failed in React verification, guess I have to wait for 3 months.


#### Day 12: June 27 2020

**Today's Progress**: 
Biweekly contest LeetCode.I was able to solve 3/4 questions. 
Did some study on P2P networks.

**Thoughts:** More work required to solve 'hard' problems.



#### Day 13: June 29 2020

**Today's Progress**: Revisited some low-level design concepts.
Lately studying Crypto concepts too. Made a plan for the month of July.

**Thoughts:** It seems like I am juggling too much. Skipped a day again. Arrgh.
