#### Day 2: June 16 2020

**Today's Progress**: 3 LC questions, a rather odd bug made me work for hours. Finalized design and name of the application.
Found a great article by @rwieruch explaining API for beginners. Do read. https://www.robinwieruch.de/what-is-an-api-javascript

**Thoughts:** I hope some real coding work starts tomorrow.
